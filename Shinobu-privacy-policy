Data Storage and Privacy Policy for Shinobu
Shinobu is committed to ensuring the privacy and security of your server's data. By default, Shinobu does not store any user-specific data. However, to ensure smooth operation, the following data may be stored temporarily:

Prefix Management: A server member with Server Management permissions can change the bot's prefix using a specific command. Upon doing so, the server's automatically generated Discord ID (e.g., 936977814421405727) will be sent to the bot along with the new prefix. This data is necessary for the bot's functionality and is stored in a secure database.

Data Usage: The prefix data is stored solely for operational purposes, allowing Shinobu to maintain its settings even when the bot is restarted. No other server-specific information is collected or retained.

User Privacy: Shinobu never stores user-specific data, ensuring that your privacy is protected. The prefix information is not shared with any third parties and is not used for any purposes beyond the operation of the bot.

Data Security: The stored data is housed on paid Virtual Private Servers (VPS), providing robust security measures to protect your information.

Data Retention: Any stored data is retained for a maximum of 30 days. After this period, the data is automatically deleted to further safeguard your privacy.

Data Deletion Requests: If you wish to request the deletion of your data, please contact me at mymarius (Discord ID: 1030495490963411045) or visit our support server to open a request.

Thank you for trusting Shinobu! We are dedicated to maintaining a secure and respectful environment for all users.
